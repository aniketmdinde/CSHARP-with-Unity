/* Variables are containers which store information 
In unity, variables can be written as
  access_specifier data_type variable_name = value; Value is conditional as per your choice
  
  1.ACCESS_SPECIFIER:
   It can be
   a) private: can be accessed within the class but not outside the class. This can be accessed in the inspector by using [SerializedField]
   b) public: can be accessed within as well as from outside the class
   
 2.DATA_TYPE; 
 Main four data types are:
  a)int: all whole nos, postive as well as negative
  b)float: all decimal nos. Always need a 'f' written after assigning a value
  c)bool: its value can be true or false
  d)string: its value is only letters or collection of letters. The value should always be written in ""
  
  3.VALUE:
  It is the stored content of a variable
  
  
Eg: public int health = 100;  
    private float speed = 12.8f;
    public string name = "Aniket";
    private bool isPlayerDead = false;
